## Overview
This is a pretty straight forward HTML and CSS challenge.  The only real difficult that I had came from now having access to the Figma design because I am not a PRO member.  That
meant that I had to do some guessing with the sizes of the image.

### What I learned
Didn't really learn anything new related to HTML or CSS as this challenge was pretty straight-forward.  I look forward to moving on to a greater degree of difficulty as I take
on other challenges and increase my skill level.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning to take designs and be able to re-create them in React.
